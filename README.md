Storage Reading
===============

Recently I've been reading more about file systems and it's kind of turned into
a little dive on the history of filesystems.

Papers/articles near the top of the list tend to be (though are not
necessarily) cited by those further down on the list. This was quickly thrown
together, is incomplete, and does not follow a standard citation format at the
moment.
